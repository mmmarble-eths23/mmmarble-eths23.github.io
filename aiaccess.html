                <h1>AI and Improving Accessibility</h1>
                <p><b>Conversations around how AI can improve accessibility focuses more on how supporting neurodivergent employees can benefit 
                    the corporation as a whole rather than how it can actually benefit neurodivergent people in society.</b>
                   
                </p>
                <p>The worth of supporting neurodivergent employees is explored nearly exclusively through the lens of what they can contribute: 
                    for example, in the article “How AI is Improving Accessibility,” the article discusses how neurodivergent employees can 
                    “outperform their neurotypical counterparts” in tasks which “require technologically-inclined and detail-oriented workers with strong skills in 
                    analytics, mathematics, pattern recognition, and information processing,” making them “the <em>more efficient</em> hire.” The Forbes article 
                    “Neurodiversity in Artificial Intelligence” does much the same, with the sentence “Neurodiversity is a competitive advantage” in the opening paragraph. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This emphasis on the usefulness of utilizing skills that neurodivergent employees bring to the workplace naturally raises the question: what 
                        of people whose neurodivergency manifests in a way which is not easily profitable?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although it is true that some neurodivergent people may possess “above average intelligence and special talents in memory, pattern recognition, 
                        and mathematics,” it is also true that neurodivergency can cause other people to struggle more with those concepts than their neurotypical peers. 
                        What accommodations can be made for them? In what ways do the changes discussed within the articles help accommodate their needs?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The language utilized in these articles, especially within the Forbes article, others neurodivergent people significantly. Even though they are 
                    writing about how these changes can improve the quality of life for neurodivergent people in the workplace, there is a distinct and noticeable 
                    lack of information given about how the people in question feel about these changes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the accommodations mentioned within the articles are underscored with mentions of how not only can they make neurodivergent employees more profitable, 
                    but moreover they can improve the workflow of neurotypical  employees as well. In fact, many of the accommodations mentioned not only seem to be minimal, 
                    but also seem to be common sense; for example, changes such as making explanations or instructions more clear and concise by stripping them of abstract speech, 
                    allowing employees private offices to improve focus and reduce distractions, or providing summaries of large bodies of text employees are expected to absorb 
                    and utilize sound like they would obviously improve workplace performance across the board. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Why are these accommodations framed in a context which emphasizes how they can improve the quality of life for neurotypical employees as well?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the Forbes article, when discussing autistic employees who are not high-functioning, they mention SYNQ3 Restaurant Solutions as an example of how AI 
                    is opening opportunities for neurodivergent employees. They end this segment by mentioning that “the company not only makes all the necessary accommodations 
                    for their neurodiverse hires, they also pay them more than the minimum wage.”
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Forbes creates a distinction between accommodations for employees and how much employees earn at their jobs. In what ways are these things distinct? 
                        If the point of accommodations is to improve the quality of life for their employees, how can a distinction be made between their workplace environment 
                        and their ability to survive on the wages said workplace provides?
                    </li>

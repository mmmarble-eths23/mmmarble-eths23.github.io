                <h1>Facebook Sued by Department of Housing and Urban Planning for Redlining Advertising Tools</h1>
                <p>Through either ignorance or a simple lack of care, Meta, also known as Facebook, managed to incorporate and actively enable redlining with their own 
                    advertising tools. <b>As technology evolves, so do the ways in which discriminatory practices manifest. Moreover, as technology advances, so too does our 
                    dependence on it, making all the more vital the necessity that the people developing and maintaining the technology and resources we use in this digital 
                    age have a good understanding of their ethical and moral responsibilities.</b> At the very least, they should have a decent enough grasp of discrimination and 
                    privacy laws to be able to not implement tools which blatantly violate people’s rights.
                </p>
                <p>In the NPR article, it mentions that even back in 2016 Facebook had come under fire for discriminatory advertising tools–specifically, 
                    access to filters “referred to as ‘Ethnic Affinities.’” However, despite saying that the issue would be addressed, it certainly was not–or, 
                    at least, not enough to avoid facing charges for discriminatory advertising tools six years later. 
                </p>

                    <li>
                        What does this say about the degree of awareness Facebook had about the inherent issues of their tools? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What methods could possibly be implemented to circumvent these sorts of situations in the future? 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As we are well aware, Facebook is a multi-billion dollar corporation. Yet, as part of the settlement agreement made with the Department of Housing 
                    and Urban Development, among promising to completely revise their advertising tools (something they had previously failed to do, albeit in circumstances 
                    less official), Facebook had to pay a penalty fee of a mere $115,054. Although mentioned to be the maximum penalty available under the Fair Housing Act, 
                    the disparity between the amount of money Facebook possesses and the amount they were made to pay in penalty is blatantly obvious.In all likelihood, the 
                    negative publicity of being sued by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development was probably a stronger deterrent to Facebook than any 
                    tangible penalty they were given.

                    <li>
                        In these circumstances, what other methods can be used to discourage parties from ignoring laws such as these when the monetary penalty is no discouragement at all?

                    <li>
                        What ethical ramifications are there to implementing monetary penalties as punishment for crimes in general?

                <h1>SIGCSE and Institutional Elitism</h1>
                <p><b>“When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is?” by Dr. Nicki Washington 
                    is an in depth exploration of the institutional barriers faced by people of color in academia, and how these barriers are maintained.</b>
                   
                </p>
                <p>During the segment on panelist and presenter considerations, Dr. Washington responds to the criticism given by one of the reviewers that because 
                    “some panelists are not a full-time tenure track faculty, it is a bit difficult to assess their technical depth,” lambasting the idea that, 
                    regardless of a person’s experience with the topic at hand, in order for their input to hold validity, it must be supported by either having a 
                    Ph.D. or their position as full-time, tenure track faculty. Dr.Washington further highlights this disparity between what people are and are not 
                    considered having adequate “technical depth,” pointing out that in a discussion about K-16 CS education, an actual K-12 educator, a Ph.D. student 
                    on track to become faculty, and the non-tenure track faculty who teach more courses per academic year than their tenure track counterparts are 
                    clearly more than qualified to offer their input on this topic. This is especially egregious considering the proposal being focused on was 
                    entirely non-technical in nature, negating the most obvious benefits the perspective of someone who held either a  Ph.D. or a tenure track 
                    position could bring to the topic.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What advantages could people with these backgrounds have over tenure track faculty in terms of adequately addressing the topic at hand? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What are some specific advantages having a Ph.D. could provide in this scenario?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dr. Washington mentions at the beginning of the article that despite her criticism of the current peer-review process for SIGCSE, she is absolutely in 
                    support of peer-review as a concept, mentioning that “we see every day in this country what happens when people are surrounded by echo chambers.” 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What are some parallels that can be drawn between the construction of “echo chambers” and the structural elitism barring the entry and 
                        input of diverse voices in academia? </li>
                    <li>
                        In what ways are the ramifications of the lack of diversity in academia apparent in the content of the anonymous reviewer’s criticism?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The steps taken to limit change to this status quo is exemplified when Dr. Washington reveals that a separate proposal she submitted was accepted 
                    despite not only there being minimal differences in the presentation between the two, but the rejected proposal on identity and identity-inclusive 
                    computing going above and beyond what was asked for, especially compared to her other proposal. This contrast highlights how the core issue of the 
                    rejected proposal is not just that it was submitted by a woman of color who is, moreover, not full-time tenure track faculty, but that it criticizes 
                    the institution currently in place.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In what ways does this relate to Dr. Washington’s claim that “[a]s always, the CS education community (especially SIGCSE) relies on people not 
                        going against the grain and accepting things with quiet rage that never discomforts anyone?” 
                    </li>
                </ul>

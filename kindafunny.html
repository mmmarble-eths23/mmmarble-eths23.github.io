                <h1>Inadequate Representation of Black Hair in Video Games</h1>
                <p><b>“We Need to Fix Black Hair in Video Games” reaffirms the necessity of including diverse voices in the creation and development of media,</b>
                     especially in a medium so integrated with user self-expression.
                   
                </p>
                <p>As someone who is black themself, many topics discussed in the video resonated significantly with my own lived experiences. 
                    As such, I deeply understand the necessity of having something even as seemingly minor as a variety of hair options available 
                    in video games, especially those with a character-creation aspect.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        When playing a game with character customization, how often do you try to make a character that looks somewhat like you? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How often have you found it impossible to create a character within one such game? What did you do instead?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Have you ever chosen not to engage with a game due to limitations on character customization?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The video mentions how, oftentimes, game modders (or, in the case of The Sims, people who create Custom Content) will take it upon themselves to 
                    add a wider variety of curly and Black hairstyles to these games.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The video game community has a history of people who originally worked on mods for a game later being hired by the company itself: 
                        what are the merits of game studios reaching out to people who have already worked on developing and modding Black hairstyles into games 
                        and hiring them to continue working on such projects in an official capacity? Or, at the very least, providing fair compensation to the modders 
                        and incorporating their work into the game (with the modder’s consent, of course). 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What possible disadvantages are there to this?                    
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Despite many games having an extended history of their community actively working on making the game more accessible to themselves and others in 
                    terms of character customization and appearance, these same games and their studios still struggle to incorporate even the bare minimum into their 
                    products, if they do so at all.

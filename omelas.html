                <h1>Those Who Walk Away From Omelas Response</h1>
                <p><b>Omelas is a direct response to and deconstruction of the idea that only art depicting pain and suffering 
                    can be considered intellectual and beautiful.</b>
                   
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you <em>enjoy</em> in art? Art in this sense can include visible art such as illustrations or sculpture, writing, music, media, etc.</li>
                    <li>What do you find <em>meaningful</em> in art? What themes do you prefer to see represented or explored?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The narrative style of Omelas continually adds more and more detail to the titular city in an attmept to convince the reader of the feasibility of
                    the city's existence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If this is the case, then what purpose does the addition of the tormented child serve? How did it influence 
                        your perception of the city’s credibility?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Why does the narrator assume that we believe happiness is correlated with naivete? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How did you initially imagine Omelas, and were any of your assumptions mentioned and/or deconstructed by the narrator?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The ones who walk away from Omelas, the final detail added by the narrator, demonstrates that where there is suffering, 
                    there will always be those who refuse to participate.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How does the narrator appear to feel about both the citizens of Omelas and those who walk away?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although the ones who walk away are presented as the alternative to those who live all their lives in Omelas, 
                    there is no mention of any of them attempting to rescue the imprisoned child. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What reasons could people who consider the treatment of the child abhorrent enough to leave Omelas 
                        behind have to never try ending the child’s suffering?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What reasons could the narrator have for not including this detail?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How would the addition of such a detail influence the story? Moreover, how would this addition influence <b>your perception</b> of the story?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The amount of graphic detail the narrator uses when describing the living conditions of the child directly juxtaposes earlier 
                    descriptions of the joyous city, directly responding to the idea that only pain and suffering is beautiful and interesting.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When reading the description of the child, how did you feel? What details stood out to you?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How did the addition of the child and the graphic nature of their suffering influence your perception of the story? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How did you feel about the story before and after the advent of the child? In what ways did your perception align with 
                        the narrator’s assumptions of the audience?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The narrator describes the people of Omelas as “happy people,” and yet also describes happiness as “based on the just discrimination of what is 
                    necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive.” The lack of cars and helicopters further implies that these categories 
                    are integral to the daily lives of the people of Omelas, and that they strictly make use without things deemed as "destructive.""

                    <li>
                        How do you believe the people of Omelas determine whether something is necessary, destructive, or neither? 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How do you believe the people of Omelas determine whether something is necessary, destructive, or neither?

                    <li>
                        How do people’s biases influence what categories they believe things may fall into?

                    <li>
                        Where do you think the child’s suffering fits within these categories?  
                    </li>
